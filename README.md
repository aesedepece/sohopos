## Current development status
THIS SOFTWARE IS UNDER STRONG DEVELOPMENT BUT STILL NOT USABLE OR EVEN USEFUL AS IT LACKS MOST FEATURES YET.

## Installing
 1. Import `sql/structure.sql` and `sql/settings.data.sql` into your MySQL setup.
 2. Create a user with full privileges over the imported tables or grant them to a existing one.
 3. Insert a row in `sellers` with your user data.
 4. Write down your database host, username and password in `index.php` as indicated by comments.
 5. Voil√†!
